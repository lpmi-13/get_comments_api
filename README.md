I basically got tired of having to always google how to do this in praw, so
I decided I would just create a python package to abstract away all the
internal praw stuff...

Somewhere along the way I thought it would be more fun to put it all into
a docker container and then have it running (intermittently) on heroku.

...So now I'm doing that.
